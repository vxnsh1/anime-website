# 🌀 Dive Into the World of Anime

This anime website is a simple yet heartfelt static website built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** way back in **2022** — my early days of web development.

This website celebrates anime culture by introducing new fans (and veterans) to:
- 🔥 Famous anime quotes
- 🎭 Genre breakdowns
- 👑 The legendary **Big 3**
- 🌟 Must-watch anime titles

While it’s not responsive (yet), it’s a tribute to what made many of us fall in love with anime.


## 🌟 Features

- 📖 **Anime Summaries**: Short intros to some iconic anime series
- 💬 **Famous Quotes**: Legendary lines that hit harder than a Rasengan
- 🧬 **Genres Explained**: Adventure? Sports? Sci-fi? Know them all
- 👑 **The Big 3**: Naruto, Bleach, One Piece — highlighted in style
- 🎌 **Basic Interactivity**: Vanilla JavaScript to keep things dynamic


## 💻 Tech Stack

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (ES6)**


## 🚫 Limitations

- ❌ Not mobile responsive
- 📦 No backend or API usage
- 📱 Best viewed on desktop/laptop

This project is preserved as-is to show where I started. Improvements may come later as I upgrade my skills.
